	<p> Before I ever stepped foot into one of its restaurants, Chick Fil A meant absolutely nothing to me. I knew that it was a fast food restaurant commonly found in the South, but I that is really all I knew about it. I first came to hear about the restaurant during a controversy that arose over Chick Fil A refusing to hire openly homosexual workers. So what I was hearing about in the media caused me to the think that this restaurant is based off of stereotypical Southern values so it could not be a restaurant for me. That all changed when a Chick Fil A opened in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chick-fil-A/@42.2862728,-71.6420465,21z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x90d3c1d608b041a0">Westborough, MA</a>.

	<p>Two of my friends, who are Georgia natives, told me that it was absolutely imperative that I go to Chick Fil A. Their enthusiasm convinced me to take a trip with them to have my first ever Chick Fil A sandwich. Upon arrival, I got in line and began looking at the menu. I was recommended to try the original chicken sandwich accompanied by waffle fries and an oreo milkshake. So I ordered exactly that. Once my food was ready, I sat at the table and unwrapped my goodies. </p>

	<p>I took off the top bun, drizzled Chick Fil A sauce on the chicken and put the bun back on. Then I picked up the sandwich and began feasting. From that point on, I no longer looked at the Chick Fil A franchise the same way. I developed an icnredible aapreciation for the tasty goodness that is Chick Fil A. that appreciation has led me to create this website for those who have yet to try Chick Fil A. Learn and Bask in the Goodness. </p>
